#This section covers the physicochemical analysis
#The puporse of this analysis is to relate DMS functional scores of mutations to changes in physicochemical properties

#All analysis was performed using R-4.0.0 
#Physicochemical properties of amino acids table was taken from:
	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147467	

#Additional information on visualization methods can be found at:

#To reproduce physicochemical analysis execute the following script
